# Face-Mask-Detection
With the spread of this new emergeant disease (COVID-19), wearing a mask is becoming an obligation.
So the need for an automated, intelligent system to detect person's who are breaking the rules is also a need, so here I'm trying to implement a solution based on Convolutional Neural Nets that automatically crop person's face from the image, pass it to a Classifier and then predicts the probability that the person is wearing a mask or not.

As I stated earlier this is just a simple try, so feel free to modify it and use it in your applications.
Have fun !
